# Contributing Guide

## Setup

For gametrakr web we use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as our runtime and package manager, to check out the current version of Bun we're using, please check the [`.tool-versions`](../web/.tool-versions) file.

### Getting started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrilhos/gametrakr.git
cd web # since we have a monorepo

bun install
```

<!-- TODO: after having a .env, update the doc -->

And then run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```
