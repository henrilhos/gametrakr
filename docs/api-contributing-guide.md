# API - Contributing Guide

## Setup

For gametrakr api we use [Go](https://go.dev/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), we also reccomend to use [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to run our scripts.

To see which versions of Go we use, check the [`.tool-versions`](../api/.tool-versions).

### Getting started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrilhos/gametrakr.git
cd api # since we have a monorepo

make compose
make dev
```
